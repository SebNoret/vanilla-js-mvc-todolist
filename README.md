# vanilla-js-mvc-todolist

A todo list project that I created as an exercice to try to implement MVC pattern In JS.
It is writen with Javascript classes and I tried to clearly separate the display from the logic of the app.
It works with the local storage API to store the todos.

## TODO 
Refactoring to clean the code. 
Maybe adding a node backend to store the todos and a template engine for the display.
